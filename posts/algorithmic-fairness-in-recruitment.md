Did you know AI recruitment tools can unintentionally perpetuate bias, leading to unfair hiring decisions? 

Consider this: Company X uses an AI-powered hiring algorithm trained on past successful employee data. The model, reflecting historical bias, repeatedly flags male candidates with computer science degrees as "most suitable" for tech roles, disregarding equally qualified female candidates with diverse educational backgrounds. This can result in a systemic exclusion, contributing to gender imbalance in tech, a major issue we've been grappling with for years. 

When it comes to AI in recruitment, how are you ensuring that fairness, diversity, and inclusion are not compromised? Share your strategies or thoughts on how we can collectively confront this challenge.
