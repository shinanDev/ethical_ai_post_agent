**Hook**: Did you know that 88% of recruiters rely on AI to sort through resumes, but these tools can harbor unseen biases?

**Example**: Consider a well-established tech company, XYZ Corp., that recently implemented an AI-powered recruitment tool to streamline its hiring process. The tool was trained on a decade's worth of XYZ Corp's hiring data, inherently learning the biases of past recruitment decisions. As a result, it disproportionately favored candidates from certain schools and underrepresented those with diverse backgrounds. This created a filtering effect, reinforcing the company's existing lack of diversity and overlooking potentially valuable talent.

**Call to Action**: As tech leaders and AI practitioners, we must actively work to mitigate such biases in our AI models. How is your organization tackling bias in AI-driven recruitment? Are there successful strategies you've implemented or challenges you're facing? I invite you to share your experiences and thoughts. Together, we can build a more equitable AI landscape.
