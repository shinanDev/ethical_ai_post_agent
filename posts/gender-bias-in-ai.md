**Did you know that your AI can inadvertently reinforce outdated gender stereotypes?** 

Take, for example, large language models (LLMs) trained on vast amounts of data from the internet. These models can often end up associating certain professions or roles with specific genders, mirroring societal biases that are present in their training data. For instance, they might suggest male pronouns for professions such as 'engineer' or 'doctor,' and female pronouns for 'nurse' or 'teacher.' This not only reinforces stereotypes but also risks creating a feedback loop, propagating these biases into future AI systems and the decisions they drive.

As we leverage AI's potential, it's crucial we also work to mitigate these biases and ensure our models promote diversity and inclusion. **What measures is your organization taking to prevent gender bias in your AI models?**
