Have you ever considered that AI, trained on historical data, might inadvertently amplify racial bias? For example, consider predictive policing, a practice that uses machine learning algorithms to forecast potential crime hotspots. These algorithms, trained on past crime data, can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in that data. Let's take the city of Oakland, where a 2016 study found that predictive policing software disproportionately targeted black neighborhoods, irrespective of actual crime rates. This, in effect, can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where these neighborhoods continue to be overpoliced, leading to an inflated crime rate, which in turn, feeds back into the predictive system. 

As AI practitioners and tech leaders, we must take responsibility for the ethical implications of our creations. How can we ensure that our AI systems learn from the past without perpetuating its biases? Let's discuss practical steps to address and mitigate these biases in our AI models.
