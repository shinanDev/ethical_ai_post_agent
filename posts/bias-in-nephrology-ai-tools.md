Did you know AI-powered medical tools can exhibit bias, inadvertently perpetuating healthcare disparities? A striking example is evident in a 2025 study (source linked below), which revealed that ChatGPT-4, a leading AI language model used in Nephrology, exhibited skewed treatment recommendations based on patient demographics such as race, gender, and age. This disparity in recommendations raises many questions about the potential impact on patient care, especially in high-stakes medical fields. 

We must remember that AI systems are not inherently objective but reflect the data and biases theyâ€™ve been trained on. In this case, the result is a potential widening of existing healthcare gaps, further disadvantaging already marginalized groups. 

As we continue to incorporate AI into healthcare, how can we ensure these tools provide equitable treatment suggestions? And for AI practitioners and tech leaders among us, what steps are you taking to mitigate these biases in your AI models?
