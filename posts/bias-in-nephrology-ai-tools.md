As we accelerate into the era of AI, it's pivotal to remember that the models we build reflect the biases embedded in the data they learn from. A 2025 study involving ChatGPT-4, an AI tool commonly used in Nephrology, brought this issue into sharp focus. The study revealed significant disparities in treatment suggestions, with the AI showing bias based on race, gender, and age. The real-world impact of such biases is far-reaching, potentially influencing clinicians' decisions and thus patient outcomes. As AI practitioners and tech leaders, we must recognize and address these biases for the sake of fairness, equity, and the very credibility of our field.

How can we better leverage diversity and inclusion principles to mitigate these biases in our AI models? Your experiences and insights are invaluable.
