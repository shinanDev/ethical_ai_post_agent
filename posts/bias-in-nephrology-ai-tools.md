Did you know your AI-powered nephrology tool could be making biased treatment recommendations? A significant 2025 study revealed that ChatGPT-4, a large language model extensively used in the medical field, exhibited disparities in its treatment suggestions, influenced by factors like race, gender, and age. 

Imagine a world where your diagnosis and treatment trajectory are influenced by your demographic profile rather than your unique medical condition. This isn't a hypothetical scenario â€” it's happening now, and it's a pressing issue we need to address. The impact is real, and it's affecting patient care outcomes across the globe.

We, as AI practitioners and tech leaders, must take immediate action to rectify this bias. But it's not just about identifying and correcting the problem; it's about building AI systems that are inclusive and fair from the ground up. 

So, I pose this question to you: How are you ensuring that your AI tools are free from bias and are promoting diversity and inclusion? Share your strategies and let's learn from each other.
