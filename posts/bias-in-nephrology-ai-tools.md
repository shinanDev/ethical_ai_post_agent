Would it surprise you to know that bias doesn't just exist in our social structures, but has permeated even our healthcare AI tools? 

A striking 2025 study exposed a concerning trend in AI-powered Nephrology tools like ChatGPT-4. These tools were found to exhibit significant disparities in treatment suggestions based on patient's race, gender, and age. For instance, an elderly Asian woman with kidney disease was likely to receive a different set of treatment recommendations than a young Black man with a comparable condition. Bias, whether intentional or not, can have serious implications on the quality of healthcare, potentially leading to misdiagnoses or suboptimal treatment plans.

As AI practitioners and tech leaders, we have a duty to ensure that our technologies are equitable and fair to all users. Let's take this as a reminder to critically evaluate our own systems for hidden biases, and to prioritize diversity and inclusion in our AI models. 

What steps are you taking to mitigate bias in your AI tools and how are you ensuring the diversity of your training datasets?
