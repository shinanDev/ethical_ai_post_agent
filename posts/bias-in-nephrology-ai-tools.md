Did you know that the AI we trust for medical recommendations could be biased? A 2025 study on ChatGPT-4, an AI tool used in nephrology, uncovered unsettling disparities in its treatment suggestions across different demographic profiles, including race, gender, and age. 

According to the research, medical recommendations were inconsistent and varied widely, leading to potential health risks for particular demographic groups. This bias not only compromises patient care but also underscores the deeper ethical issues we face in AI development. 

Imagine a world where a patient's treatment outcome is influenced by the biases of an AI tool. This scenario is not just a theory, but a real-world impact we need to address now. 

As AI practitioners, tech leaders, and stakeholders in responsible innovation, we must ensure that our AI models are inclusive and unbiased. How are you addressing bias in your AI tools? What steps is your organization taking to ensure fair and equitable AI?
