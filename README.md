## Motivation & Inspiration

As AI systems increasingly influence social, economic, and political realities, it's crucial to embed ethics into the development pipeline.  
This agent was built to:

- Make bias and fairness in LLMs more visible  
- Automate education on overlooked but critical topics  
- Support responsible AI communication in public discourse

`ethical_ai_post_agent` is my way of using technology to bring **awareness, reflection, and change** into the feed.

üß† Let‚Äôs build AI with **intention** ‚Äî not just with instructions.
